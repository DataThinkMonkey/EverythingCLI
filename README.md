# Everything CLI
List of command line programs that perform common desktop computing tasks. 

**Objective:** This is my effort to show that anything on the Desktop can be
done in a console. This is my comprehensive list of Desktop tasks and the
command line tools that can perform those tasks.

This list is meant to be as comprehensive as possible. 

Please submit pull requests or submit an issue for any changes. The list of GUI
apps is not meant to be complete, but only serve as a reference when looking
for a possible replacement by the CLI app.

Added

* ticker.sh (Real-time Stock ticker) to Business. 
* Reference [SAL](http://sai.msu.su/sal/) site in Education.md for CLI apps for Astronomy, Biology and Chemistry, Physics. The SAL website has a large reference of Scientific applications that run on Linux. This reference will need to be eventually hashed out due to its volume and may even warrant creating it's own section on this list, possibly Science.md. Adding this to to-do task.
* Referenced Bib Tex for Bibliography. There seems to be several ways to implement. Requires more research, but applies a reference for those needing this type of tool. Adding to to-do list.

Removed

* mscmdlineutils from Business.md - project no longer active. 
* pysh from Shells - Project no longer active.
* e from Education.md/Mathmatical - Unable to find project.
* amap form Education/Biology and Chemistry. - Unable to find project.
