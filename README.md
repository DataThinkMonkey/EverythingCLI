# Everything CLI
List of command line programs that perform common desktop computing tasks. 

**Objective:** This is my effort to show that anything on the Desktop can be
done in a console. This is my comprehensive list of Desktop tasks and the
command line tools that can perform those tasks.

This list is meant to be as comprehensive as possible. 

Please submit pull requests or submit an issue for any changes. The list of GUI
apps is not meant to be complete, but only serve as a reference when looking
for a possible replacement by the CLI app.
